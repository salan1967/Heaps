# Heaps
in this assignment, I implemented a Minimum Binary Heap in Java, ensuring that the smallest integer always remains at the root. Unlike a priority queue, this heap is solely focused on maintaining proper heap order. I completed the required methods in MinHeap.java, following the structure provided by the Heap interface, without modifying Heap.java. Key operations include insertion, deletion, retrieval, sorting, and heap construction, all adhering to min-heap properties. This project reinforced my understanding of heap operations, array-based tree structures, and sorting mechanisms in Java.
